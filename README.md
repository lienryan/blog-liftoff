# blog-liftoff


## Overview

My project is a travel blog that allows users to create and read blog posts. Users are be able to create an account, log in, create, edit and delete their blog posts.

I decided to make this project because I am passionate about travelling and I want to share my experiences with the amazing places I have travelled. This is the place for users to share their travel experiences.

## Features

User login: Users are be able to create accounts and log in to the application. Each user will have a profile page.
